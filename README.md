EApp — Personal Project

This project is my ongoing attempt to build a clean, modern, and user-friendly coffee ordering application.
I’m creating it step by step, focusing on both the technical foundation and the experience for the user.

What I’ve used so far
I integrated Firebase as the backend service for:
Authentication (login & signup)
User data storage
Realtime updates
Secure data handling
Firebase helps me keep things simple, reliable, and fast while I focus on building the app’s features and UI.

What’s done
I’ve fully completed the Dashboard UI, including:
User header section
Search and filter components
Category blocks
Clean layout with a smooth, minimalistic design
Right now the dashboard looks polished and functional.

Next step
My upcoming task is to implement the banner section, which will highlight promotions, special offers, or personalized recommendations.
This will make the dashboard feel more alive and give users something new every time they open the app.
